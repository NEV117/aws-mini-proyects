## Considerations

- Default region is `us-east-1`, ami's and other configurations are intended to work in this region only (if someone is reusing this change these type of parameters as needed)
- Focus on `Cloud Formation` and `AWS CLI`
- Most projects are intended to be cost-effective so im using minimal resouces on the solutions.
- The projects are intended to be scalable so they can be easily expanded or modified as needed.
- The projects are intended to be secure so they use best practices for security and compliance.
- No problem on using this as a personal, educational, or comercial purposes but consider that im not reponsable for overspending or misconfigurations.
- The Code on the applications may not be the best it is not my focus, im keeping it simple :P
